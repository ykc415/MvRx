 * Implement this in a custom view to expose [fragmentViewModel] and [activityViewModel] in a custom view. Similar to usage in Fragments,
 * this will create a view-lifecycle-aware subscription.
 * For [fragmentViewModel], this will walk up the view hierarchy until it finds a View that is the root view for a Fragment.
 * [StatefulView] uses [onInvalidate] instead of `invalidate()` because `invalidate()` is already a function on View. It is also
 * not called [MvRxView] because the name was already taken.
